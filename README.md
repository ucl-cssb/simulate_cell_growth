The program simulates the growth of a population of cells, with mutations (and selections) introduced along the way.

The population starts growing from a single cell, following exponential growth.
Mutations are introduced into cell division according to Poisson distribution.
Subclones with growth (dis)advantages can be introduced by specifying the minimal and maximal frequencies and minimal and maximal appearance time.
